I love to read more than one book at the same time, on Kindle and in\n    <g class=\"gr_ gr_216 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar only-ins doubleReplace replaceWithoutSep\" id=\"216\" data-gr-id=\"216\">paper</g>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mum, Dad stayed over on Friday which was really good as they usually dash off after looking after Arthur on Friday afternoon and we don&#x27;t get to spend much time with them sans-Arthur. Rob came to visit as well on his way back home from Bath. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Dry January</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The start of the year is a good place to reset the body and refresh the mind so this year I have been doing Dry January. So far I have found it easy &#8211; having a pregnant wife means I am not the only one not drinking. The only times that I wished I could have a drink were on Friday evenings after long weeks, or when people I am with were drinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n"},{"date":"2017-10-28T16:48:49","id":3354,"title":"Wow, using Quill to write to my website","excerpt":"<p>here is something nice.

But this was far from perfect so I:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Deferred the loading of the web font.

I use Gulp, Bower and Continuous deployment to streamline everything. </p>\n<h2>Gulp</h2>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using Gulp for about 6 months (and Grunt for a similar time before that) and it is incredible in that I can automate most of the small tasks that make a site faster to develop and to load.</p>\n<p>For example, I&#8217;ve started to use <strong>uncss</strong> which removes extraneous CSS after comparing the html on a specified set of pages with the CSS file and removing any CSS that is not required. Awesome!</p>\n<p>I use <strong>autoprefixer</strong> to add in or remove vendor prefixes (depending on the latest specs). At the moment I can specify which browsers I want to support and I chose to have &#8216;the latest 2 versions&#8217;. </p>\n<p>I use <strong>gulp-sass</strong> which combines and minifies the CSS from the .scss files. It is super-shit-hot fast compared to Grunt.</p>\n<p>Good use of <strong>livereload</strong> to monitor my code and refresh the browser when I&#8217;ve done something. No more cmd-r for me!</p>\n<p>I also remove console.log() and alert() from the JS, lint my WordPress php, and create SVG spritesheets.</p>\n<h2>Bower</h2>\n<p>One simple line of code fetches jquery and adds it to your project </p>\n<pre>bower install jquery</pre>\n<p>. Before you had to go to the jquery site, manually download, then create a new file in your project and save the new file. Such effort is now reduced to a single line of command line.</p>\n<h2>Continuous Deployment</h2>\n<p>I used to use Capistrano and that was incredible but required you to manually type a deployment instruction when you were ready to deploy, and a lot of setting up too.</p>\n<p>DeployHQ reduces all of that and it monitors Github (where I keep my code) for a signal to deploy the code. So if I push code to a specific branch it goes live straight away. Incredible!</p>\n"}],[{"date":"2014-08-16T10:44:54","id":2632,"title":"Goodbye Facebook","excerpt":"<p>What is the point of Facebook if not to compare yourself with others.

Here&#8217;s why.</p>\n<p>For many years I have had a Facebook account but have hardly ever used it. Sometimes I shared pictures, or messages, sometimes just to keep up with the news of people that I used to go to school and university, or out of touch friends. But what for? To look over the shoulder or through the window of those you used to know, of people from your past. What is the point of this?</p>\n<p>Recently we moved house and the estate has its own Facebook group, and I would often spend time reading the (mostly idiotic) messages left there; people complaining and getting wound up over the smallest things. What a waste of time it all is. Isn&#8217;t time better spent learning and doing rather than comparing your life to that of others?</p>\n<p>So. Slowly the process began. Removing people from my Facebook (unfriending them), people that I went to school with, people that I never really cared about in the first place. Then the Facebook groups, then Facebook itself. Download all your history (and uploaded photos). Then press the blue button to delete Facebook (takes 14 days). I feel free, more free than I did last week.</p>\n<p><strong>Update: (22.12.2014)</strong> I have just signed up to Facebook again, this time for reasons that I can keep in contact with Family with baby photos after Marion has given birth.

We collected them on Weds evening and it took them a while to get used to their new house and us &#8211; Punku still needs some litter training (he doesn&#8217;t like walking in the litter tray!) But they are getting crazier and crazier as each day passes. Fighting each other and playing with the home-made string toys and leaping all over the place and exploring everywhere. Taking photos of them is difficult because they move so fast and are so black. I&#8217;ll continue to take lots of photos and put them up here.</p>\n"},{"date":"2012-10-05T10:29:27","id":444,"title":"XKCD","excerpt":"","content":"<p><img src=\"/shared/2012/10/sky.png\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/shared/2012/10/traffic_lights.gif\" alt=\"\" /><br />\n<img src=\"/shared/2012/10/my_sky.png\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n"}],[{"date":"2012-09-29T11:17:31","id":417,"title":"George Ezra &#8211; It&#8217;s Just My Skin","excerpt":"","content":"<p><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F61003072&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxwidth=500&#038;maxheight=750\"></iframe></p>\n"},{"date":"2012-09-14T20:24:20","id":299,"title":"Going on Holiday to France","excerpt":"<p>Tomorrow morning we&#8217;ll catch the train to Gatwick Airport then fly to Marseille for a week in Provence.

Thus I had the choice of hanging up my road bike and doing no exercise during the week or to continue the good work that I had done on the bike since starting road cycling in July. Of course I could have switched to running after work â€” and indeed I might do that as well â€” but I am obsessed about cycling and wanted to see what the Turbo Trainer had to offer!</p>\n<p>I have so far done four different sessions since starting last Tuesday, going every other day for 30mins+. The first session was the hardest because I didn&#8217;t know what I was letting myself in for, and I was training in front of one of <a href=\"http://www.thesufferfest.com/\">The Sufferfest</a> videos &#8211; supposed to be the hardest cycling workout videos on the market. Each week I will increase the duration by five minutes and see where that gets me, and each week I will train once to a sufferfest video to keep me extra motivated.</p>\n<p>Having no access to training books I am experimenting with what works best but always include a good warmup, and alternations between hard and medium with some recovery in between. I use my Garmin 405 to track my heartrate and plan to get a cadence attachment so I can measure how fast I am peddling (I&#8217;ve read that a cadence of 90-110 rpm is optimum).</p>\n<p>Hopefully there will be some weekends where I can go out riding where I will see how much effect this training is having, plus it will be great to taste the fresh country air again.</p>\n"},{"date":"2011-09-17T15:56:07","id":1081,"title":"Fourtet Remix of Radiohead","excerpt":"<p>Separator &#8211; Four Tet RMX by Radiohead via Fourtet.net</p>\n","content":"<p><object height=\"81\" width=\"400\"><param name=\"movie\" value=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F20025003&#038;\"></param><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\"></param><embed allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"81\" src=\"http://player.soundcloud.com/player.swf?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F20025003&#038;\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"100%\"></embed></object><span><a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/radiohead/03-separator-four-tet-rmx\">Separator &#8211; Four Tet RMX</a> by <a href=\"http://soundcloud.com/radiohead\">Radiohead</a></span></p>\n<p>via <a href=\"http://www.fourtet.net/\">Fourtet.net</a></p>\n"},{"date":"2011-09-16T11:39:14","id":1072,"title":"Awesome Thom York Mix","excerpt":"<p>Thom Yorke MoneyBack Mix &#8211; Xfm Music: Response 15/09/11 by Mary Anne Hobbs on Mixcloud</p>\n","content":"<div><object width=\"400\" height=\"100\" classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\"><param name=\"allowFullScreen\" value=\"true\" /><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\" /><param name=\"allowscriptaccess\" value=\"always\" /><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/media/swf/player/mixcloudLoader.swf?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2FMaryAnneHobbs%2Fthom-yorke-moneyback-mix-xfm-music-response-150911%2F&amp;embed_uuid=e8a683ff-f852-43f9-87cf-85412e505197&amp;embed_type=widget_standard\" /><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\" /><embed width=\"400\" height=\"100\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" src=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/media/swf/player/mixcloudLoader.swf?feed=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2FMaryAnneHobbs%2Fthom-yorke-moneyback-mix-xfm-music-response-150911%2F&amp;embed_uuid=e8a683ff-f852-43f9-87cf-85412e505197&amp;embed_type=widget_standard\" allowFullScreen=\"true\" wmode=\"opaque\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" /></object></p>\n<p style=\"display: block; font-size: 12px; font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; margin: 0; padding: 3px 4px; color: #999;\"><a style=\"color: #02a0c7; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/thom-yorke-moneyback-mix-xfm-music-response-150911/#utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;amp;utm_term=resource_link\" target=\"_blank\">Thom Yorke MoneyBack Mix &#8211; Xfm Music: Response 15/09/11</a><br />\n<span> by </span><a style=\"color: #02a0c7; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/MaryAnneHobbs/#utm_source=widget&amp;amp;utm_medium=web&amp;amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;amp;utm_term=profile_link\" target=\"_blank\">Mary Anne Hobbs</a><span> on </span><a style=\"color: #02a0c7; font-weight: bold;\" href=\"http://www.mixcloud.com/#utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=base_links&amp;utm_term=homepage_link\" target=\"_blank\"> Mixcloud</a></p>\n</div>\n"},{"date":"2011-08-01T21:27:44","id":1063,"title":"Sixty miles!","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s been a bloody long time since I rode that far on a bike and the final 10 miles were those of a suffering knackered empty excuse for a cyclist who is paying for his lack of fitness and over eager speed-demon start.

For a group of developers to work on the same code at the same time, to track what they have done, we need a version control system and git is one of the excellent alternatives out there, as well as Mercurial and SVN (both of which I use at work). I had a basic introduction earlier this month when I was doing the <a href=\"http://chirontransformation.com\">Chiron Transformation Website</a> but beyond that I knew very little how to do more than the most basic of functions, so I want to learn more!</p>\n<p>Otherwise I want to turn my website <a  href=\"http://www.big-andy.co.uk\">big-andy.co.uk</a> fully into a wordpress website, improve this blog and add some more features (e.g. HTML5 to the form), and write more often on this blog about what I am doing. I also want to add a portfolio section where I document which websites I have made and how I did them.</p>\n<h3>Weekend</h3>\n<p>This weekend I am going to Buxton in Derbyshire walking with the entire Pidgeon (my mum&#8217;s side of the family) clan.

This week I finally have fiber-optic internet and now I am looking to extend my passion for speed through in relation to THIS website.</p>\n<p>Why am I going to do this? I hate waiting for a website to load, you hate it too, right? There&#8217;s far too much you&#8217;d prefer to be doing than waiting for a download to happen or a web page to open.</p>\n<p>How am I going to do this?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compression of files (CSS and javascript),</li>\n<li>use of heavy browser caching (via the .htaccess file),</li>\n<li>use of database caching (this is done by a wordpress plugin called W3 Total Cache)</li>\n<li>use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN)</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>1. Compression</h2>\n<p>The larger the file the longer it takes to download resulting in a much slower page load time compared to when the files are compressed. Personally I use the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-css/\">WP CSS</a> plugin although now I have installed the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/w3-total-cache/\">W3 Total Cache</a> (W3TC) plugin I might remove it and trust W3TC to do it all. When developing a site normally one might split the styles into a number of different style sheets (e.g. content.css, layout.css, reset.css, fonts.css) but this is a bad move. Each file requires request puts more strain on the internet connection and thus has a big impact on page speed. I combine all my css into one stylesheet (including the print css too) as recommended in the <a  href=\"http://html5boilerplate.com/\">HTML5 Boilerplate</a> .</p>\n<h2>2. Caching</h2>\n<p>Browser caching is the process that web browsers use to keep the files associated with a web page (css, javascript, images, and so on) on file so that they don&#8217;t need to be downloaded again if the user visits another page in the site, or even comes back after visiting another site. As a website administrator you can change the amount of time that the browser will keep the files, so that the browser keeps files for a long time and don&#8217;t need to continually download them. On Apache servers this can be controlled using by changing settings in the .htaccess file in the root folder of your site. There is excellent documentation on best practice on the HTML5 boilerplate website.</p>\n<h2>3. Database Caching</h2>\n<p>Using a database driven website is great if you are writing a blog or another data-heavy website, but when a lot of users start to visit your site the amount of work that the server has to do each time a user visits adds up and will become a bottleneck on high-traffic sites. If, however, you cache the pages using a plugin and store the pages as static files then the server doesn&#8217;t need to do anything once a user visits, just display the content (like any non database driven site). I am using w3TC to do this.</p>\n<h2>4. Content Delivery Network</h2>\n<p>The world is a big place and even with today&#8217;s fast internet connections the users &#8211; if for example your web server is situated in London &#8211; from USA are going to have a different page load time compared to those in London. If, however, you have access to a CDN your images, css, javascript (and so on) are hosted on a number of different servers all around the world, so your user in USA will have a much faster page load speed. I am trying out <a href=\"http://www.maxcdn.com/\">Max CDN</a> (after hearing of them and doing an offer through <a href=\"http://appsumo.com\">AppSumo</a>). I&#8217;ll let you know how it goes&#8230; I have just setup my package so will see how it goes over the next week or so!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n"},{"date":"2011-04-18T22:13:03","id":863,"title":"Back to Running!","excerpt":"<p>A gorgeous evening to go running it&#8217;s the first time since winter that I&#8217;ve been out and the sun was shining and it was hot.

You see for me the more I write the easier writing becomes. Yes yes yes onwards with the post! In the previous post I wrote down the key highlights of what I did in 2010 and now in this post I will write what I hope to do this year.</p>\n<h3>Improve Fitness</h3>\n<p>I have not done much exercise since I changed careers back in August and I&#8217;d like to change this by doing more in the coming year. I&#8217;ve been playing badminton with my friend Rob but this is only every other week, I&#8217;d like to play more. Otherwise I want to re-start my running, go once or twice a week, and go swimming at the local pool once a week.</p>\n<h3>Learn French</h3>\n<p>Having proposed to Marion and having completed my Web-Design qualification I now have more time to do more studying and I want to re-start learning French. I plan to start a French qualification in February at the local university.</p>\n<h3>Learn more Web Languages</h3>\n<p>Already it&#8217;s the second week of January and I have been busy beginning my quest to learn Javascript so I can apply this knowledge at work and in my own projects. It&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve long wanted to do and just before Christmas I began <a href=\"http://courses.sitepoint.com/javascript-live\">Sitepoint&#8217;s Javascript Live</a> course. At work have also been learning some jQuery too. Secondly I want to learn more PHP so I can improve my skills within WordPress (see next point) and have some experience with back-end web development.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Theming</h3>\n<p>Currently 20% of the world&#8217;s websites are run using <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/\">WordPress</a> which is the opensource blog/CMS platform which is also the platform that I use to run this blog. I have begun learning how to make my own themes and about how WordPress works in greater detail. I want to become a WordPress Themer (someone who makes themes, possibly to sell them or use them on other peoples websites).</p>\n<h3>Write and Read</h3>\n<p>I have already started to keep a log of all the books (currently it&#8217;s in a notebook but hopefully sometime I will add a page to this blog where I will detail them) that I have read which should motivate me to read more books. Second to this I want to write more too, both in the form of blog posts here and also to keep in better contact with friends.</p>\n<p>I know that this is a big list but hopefully I will be able to succeed with the majority of them. Until next time, adios amigos!</p>\n"},{"date":"2011-01-15T14:18:00","id":670,"title":"The Year 2010","excerpt":"<p>To start again you have to let go of the past and move forward to free yourself of the baggage that weighed you down.

In April 2008 I persuaded myself and my girlfriend (now fiancee) Marion that I wanted to change career and it would be great if I would do some training in web designâ€”something that I had been dreaming of ever since teaching myself to code after graduating from universityâ€”and she pointed out an advert to Advent Training who had been doing lots of adverts on the TV and internet at the time.</p>\n<p>The first two modules of the &#8220;Masters CIW Designer&#8221; course were CompTIA A+ and A+ Technician exam. Basically to get me to be able to install, fix, troubleshoot any hardware or software in Windows. I really enjoyed being able to learn more about what goes on inside the computers and was able to learn a lot of useful stuff.</p>\n<p>The next moduleâ€”the first of the CIW modulesâ€”was called CIW Foundations. It taught a little about coding, but was mostly about networking, business and very basic web stuff.</p>\n<p>The penultimate module, CIW Site Designer, was my favorite and was mostly about coding websites in different languages (although mainly HTML). I read a lot of other books at the time, books about Web Standards, Usability, and went to several UX meetups in London, I revamped my own website using all that I&#8217;d learnt and started applying for jobs in web design/development. I got the job that I was dreaming of and thus made my own progression from Chemist to Web Developer. It was after passing this exam that I found out that the company that I was doing the course throughâ€”Advent Trainingâ€”had gone bust and I was thus left in a haitus not knowing whether I could finish my course. Luckily a new company came along and I could continue my course.</p>\n<p>The final exam was CIW E-commerce and it really sucked. I hate most (though not all) of the topics and studying was a nightmare because of my new job and not having the energy or motivation to sit down and study after a long day on the computer at work. So this month I have taken a number of days off as holiday from work and stuck to it, learning and revising the subjects in the book. Today I took the exam in Wokingham and passed with 84% (the pass mark was 68%). I am very happy now as you can imagine! You can call me a &#8220;CIW Web Design Professional&#8221; if you&#8217;d like to. Otherwise Andy is good for me;)</p>\n<p>Now I can focus on enjoying life a little and absorbing the festive Christmas atmosphere.

While out running it gives you pace information, you can train against a virtual partner, and see which <a  href=\"http://www.brianmac.co.uk/hrm1.htm\">Heart Rate Zone</a> you are in. So far I have used it twice as you can see below.</p>\n<p>We are going to do <a  href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GR20\">Corsica&#8217;s GR20</a> this August/September. Rumoured to be the hardest toughest long-distance path in the world, this is something that we&#8217;ve been dreaming of since we started going out 3 years ago. We&#8217;ve booked the flights to Corsica and now the training begins!</p>\n<p><a  href=\"http://connect.garmin.com/activity/37915229\">First Training Run</a> &#8211; running at lunchtime is great in that you can go while you are full of energy but our shower at work is in a small room with no air extraction and on a hot day like this I was hotter and wetter after the shower than before.<br />\nThis route was one that I have done plenty of times before and is one of the shortest. The day was hot and sunny and as this was my first run since May 10th I wanted a short route.</p>\n<p><a  href=\"http://connect.garmin.com/activity/37915226\">Second Training Run</a> &#8211; aiming to stay under 70% of max-HR (Heart Rate) I&#8217;m still really unfit so I couldn&#8217;t keep my HR below 90% for any time &#8211; without resorting to walking &#8211; so I ran slow enough and stayed at approx 90% for the entire run. The day was hot and sunny but compared to the run on Monday I was able to enjoy running and the fantastic day, look at the scenery along the canal.</p>\n<p>I am amazed at all the stats that the watch/computer gives me and you can upload the routes to the Garmin Connect website where you can see your route on google maps, see all the heart rate/pace/time information as well as calories burnt, elevation climbed/descended, and more. I will keep on training with the watch and post the results here.</p>\n"},{"date":"2010-06-17T22:18:10","id":548,"title":"A new Dawn &#8211; A new Speedo!","excerpt":"<p>New Speedo for my bike!

Not just a camera but also a camera rucsac, filters, 50mm Nikkor f1.8 lens, a huge reflector, and spare battery, and battery grip. The weather this week since the camera arrived has been dodgy. Raining 60% of the time and dark the other 40%. I took the camera out on Tue night to try it outside, as well as testing out on Marion at every opportunity too!</p>\n<p>Last night (Thu) was the second lesson. We learnt about ISO, Aperture and Shutter Speed. And this time we were put into pairs and told to go into the canteen and take photos of each other. My partner Gareth had an enormously heavy D300 and 18-200mm combination. It was difficult for me with my 50mm lens not being able to zoom in/out, it&#8217;s going to take a long time to get used to that! But but but I do have the lens of my film camera (Nikon f80) which is a sigma 28-80mm f3.5 zoom. The quality of lenses are not the same (the Nikkor lens being better) but until I get more lens(es) this is all I have to shoot with.</p>\n<p>My homework:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>3 shots of the same scene using different white balance (WB) settings (including which one is using the &#8220;correct&#8221; WB);</li>\n<li>3 shots under Aperture Priority (f11)\n<ol>\n<li>1 shot @ 1/30;</li>\n<li>1Â  shot @ 1/125;</li>\n<li>1 shot @ 1/500.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>3 shots under Shutter Priority (1/60):\n<ol>\n<li>1 shot @ Large D.o.F (depth of Field);</li>\n<li>1 shot @ Medium DoF;</li>\n<li>1 shot @ Small DoF</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I must include how I made these shots.

Blue skies, a slight breeze and warm temperature (not too hot).</p>\n<p>The first 4 miles were good fun, I was enjoying the event and enjoying the music that I was listening to. Not rushing, just keeping myself moving at a standard pace. At 4 miles I needed the loo but there was no toilet until the 10k mark. I kept going as I knew I had to. The atmosphere was amazing, even though I had music in my ears and sunglasses over my eyes I was smiling knowing that there were many many thousands supporting the 16,000+ participants, some making music or holding signs supporting friends family and lovers, others just enjoying the multi-coloured parade of people whooshing past their feet.</p>\n<p>Anyway, after 10k there was a toilet and afterwards I was much better for a couple of miles before having to stop again at the next stop. After this I knew that I could get to the finish line and collect my medal. I passed close to my house, going past the Nag&#8217;s Head where they had a table with beer and pork scratchings (a huge cheer went up when someone grabbed a beer, or pork scratchings!). The most difficult part was the long long straight road A33 towards the Stadium (where we were to finish) because you could see the stadium but it took a very long time to appear. Anyway, eventually, it did appear and I made it to the finish line.</p>\n<p>One Hour fifty-One. The slowest ever that I have run 13.1 miles but not the worst. Considering my poor preparation, and lack of fitness going into the race that&#8217;s all that I could have possibly hoped for!</p>\n<p>It was <a href=\"http://www.marionmouttou.co.uk\">Marion&#8217;s</a> first ever half-marathon and she completed it and looked rather sexy doing so. Congratulations Marion!</p>\n"},{"date":"2009-03-25T20:10:21","id":1244,"title":"Spring Un-Sprung","excerpt":"<p>Good Evening Folks, Sitting here in two jumpers a pair of gloves, scarf, hat and cup of hot tea it&#8217;s not that spring-like anymore.

I am now on CIW Foundations (part 3 out<br />\nof 5) which deals with the basics of web-design, re-covers networking, and<br />\nintroduces project management. Hopefully I will arrive in time to see some<br />\nfootball in a pub. A couple of days away from work, it seems as though all<br />\nmy holiday has been taken away by going on these IT courses in<br />\nKidderminster, will be good and nice to relax on the train and get some<br />\nreading done.</p>\n<p><strong>Football</strong>. It&#8217;s Champions League week this week (quarter finals first leg)<br />\nand last night ManU drew with Inter in Milan. It was a great game but ManU<br />\nshould have taken a few goals back to Manchester for the return leg in two<br />\nweeks. The first half was a lot better in terms of possession and chances<br />\nfor ManU (how did they not score?) but then in the second-half Inter got<br />\nback into the game and had a few chances themselves. ManU, however, should<br />\nhave scorred with the final kick of the game from a free-kick from Ronaldo<br />\nwhich (luckily for the keeper who hadn&#8217;t seen the flight of the ball) was<br />\nat the keeper. I watched it round my friend Cesar&#8217;s house, cheers Cesar for<br />\nthe beer and pizza!<br />\nTonight it&#8217;s:<br />\nChelsea v Juventus<br />\nVillarreal v Panathinaikos<br />\nSporting Lisbon v Bayern Munich<br />\nReal Madrid v Liverpool</p>\n<p><strong>Running</strong>. I&#8217;ve not been running in a couple of weeks. Lazy me. But I will go<br />\nrunning soon I promise. It&#8217;s a viscious cycle when you stop running. You<br />\nwant to go and you feel that you need to go but you feel that the days<br />\nsince you went running last are counting against you in some mad crazy way.<br />\nPlus it&#8217;s sometimes easier just to stay inside and not go running. Now it&#8217;s<br />\ngetting lighter and lighter in the evenings the excuse or reason that I was<br />\ntoo tired at work to go running is becoming non-valid so I can go running<br />\nalong the river in my evenings after work. I much prefer going running in<br />\nclean air along a river, than along a canal and along roads (as I do at<br />\nwork).

Last night spent wishing Keryn a farewell, we went to Oakford Social Club then Purple Turtle. Too much drink in too short a time, Sat morning was difficult! Trains to Oxford replaced by bus so had to re-think and decided on Windsor instead. Brilliant bright blue sunny day, bloody cold though. Took the train and arrived at lunchtime and walked around, then out into Windsor Great Park along the Great Walk. Back towards town and a late lunch in any pub we could find. More shops to see and then back to see my Parents in Sandhurst. This the first time all 4 of them were together (last summer Marion&#8217;s Mum met my parents) and it was a delicious evening, with lots of food and great company. To finish off we played Arsehole (or trou-du-cul), then skated on ice home.</p>\n<p><strong>Sun: </strong>We walked around the sights of Reading (along the river and through town, stopping off at the excellent <a  href=\"http://www.yelp.co.uk/biz/picnic-foods-reading\">Picnic</a> for some warm soup (it was bloody raining and freezing outside). My <a  href=\"http://www.rob-hudson.com/\">brother</a>also came to have a cuppa and meet the parents on Sunday too. In the eve we had take-away curry and watched &#8220;Breakfast at Tiffanys&#8221;.</p>\n<p><strong>Mon: </strong>A day to see London. A very wet day not to venture out of the house unless totally necessary. No choice but to brave the conditions and go into London. First stop was the <a  href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/\">Tate Modern </a>although I&#8217;d seen the normal exhibitions before it was good to go again, to see the strange weird and demenous paintings. I love the Tate Modern! Lunch in a pub by the river then walked towards Covent Garden along Fleet Street and into the Twinnings shop. We also took in Ben&#8217;s Cookies, China Town, Leicester Square and then finally, made it back to the train towards home. Knackered and cold. More curry and &#8220;A Life of Brian&#8221; for more britanica for our foreign guests.

This week I am going with M on holiday to Turkey: for 1 week in the sun on the sand in the sea on the beach, soaking up rays of suntan inducing sun enjoying being a tourist in a foreign land! I cannot wait, the last 6 months since Christmas/NY have been long and tiring and I need a proper break. Shocked by the price of diesel last Thu when I filled my car up: Â£73.59 for a tank of 125.9/litre of diesel, up 20p/litre since when I bought the car back in November last year. Shocked. Where is the alternative to using my car? I use my car to get to and from work every day 65 miles a day, 325 miles a week, plus some weekend trips. That&#8217;s a lot of money to pay. Option 1. travel to work by train. Yes more cheap (i think it costs Â£60 a week) but takes 3 hours there and back rather than 1.5 when driving and large number of connections mean that if any train is delayed I am very late home or at work. Option 2. Move closer to work. Not realistic at the moment. Option 3. Move job closer to home. Not realistic at the moment.</p>\n<p>Running: Last night I went out with M after work. Felt initially very low energy from day at work but glad went out. We did the same course apart from the final section. A new <a href=\"http://www.gmap-pedometer.com/?r=1954973\">[Uni PP &#8211; 3.9miles]</a> route. M did 3.1 miles and I did 3.9 in 25 and 30mins, respectively. Last week went out with M once (Woodley) and myself (2laps of PP). Have stopped taking the vitamin tablets since beginning (7th) of May and seeing what this makes to us. So far have less energy and more tired, but this could be to do with the amount of things that we are doing. So. Will give it another month or so and see how feeling then!</p>\n"}],[{"date":"2008-05-07T16:03:27","id":1200,"title":"Wednesday or Monday?","excerpt":"<p>Back from 6 days of rest.

Into the rain I went and out the other side just before getting back home in the middle of the exit to the roundabout was a police car blocking all onward traffic. This was a place where there were few (if any) routes around so I went back, cut across country and then got stuck in more rush-hour traffic going back into Reading. Arrived home after 90 mins in the car I needed to go out running. After yesterday&#8217;s 10k race my legs were a bit stiff so I blasted around PP on the first lap and then coasted for the second. Time: approx 20mins. Distance: 2.6miles.Â  After having a shower I now am feeling much better!</p>\n"},{"date":"2008-04-14T14:59:07","id":1193,"title":"Spring!","excerpt":"<p>Spring Is Here!

Have dinner according to the food diet that I have to follow and then speak to Marion on the fone. Knackered knackered knackered. I need a break. I need to go running. I did go running on Tuesday, 1hr at 11.7kmph on the treadmill for the study. Not proper running outside but hard work running on the treadmill. Never done that before, preferring more to go running in the outside world and feeling the freshness of life on my skin (rain, wind, snow, sunshine, etc!). I have to follow this controlled diet so I am not allowed certain foods, and NO ALCOHOL, I cannot wait until Saturday when I can drink and eat as much of whatever I want to, and go running too!!! Yes!!!<br />\nTomorrow night I will go to Reading and meet up with the boys to watch the England footie game vs Austria. No booze for me but it will be good to get out on the town and see friends. Marion and I went to Paris at the start of the month, taking the Eurostar on a Thu evening and arriving at her friends&#8217; house via another set of friends. We had a great time, I met with lots of her friends and saw much of the sights of Paris by foot. <a href=\"http://www.big-andy.co.uk/Photos/Photos_Paris_Nov2007/\">Here are the fotographs::: </a>. Great food too, I love French food!!! Especially love patisseries, chocolateries, supermarches, creperies (crepes and nutella are simply devine!!!), and so on :) We stayed at Helene&#8217;s place first (she was on holiday) and then were shown the sights of Paris by Line, Jalabert and their 9mth-old baby Lisa. The Eiffel Tower by night is simply stunning (see the fotos!) <br /><img src=\"http://www.big-andy.co.uk/Photos/Photos_Paris_Nov2007/Andrew's/thumbs/IMG_3068.JPG\" /> and lisa is soo entertaining! Marion and I went to a restaurant and had simple delicious food. Next day Marion and I went to Monmartre and had crepes for brunch, found Line, Jalabert and Lisa and did more touring. In the evening Marion and I took the sardine train to see another set of her friends Didier and Lucie and we had the most amazing chocolate fondue ever, preceeded by salad and duck. It was great, with fresh fruit just dipping the stuff into the molten chocolate and eating it.!. Choco-holics heaven :) Following morning Marion and I stocked up on French goodies, then to Paris central again via a chinese supermarket for essential foods! We did a walk along the Seine and then had chocolate crepes for lunch. Marion and I then went to see Line Jalabert and Lisa one more time and taste their amazing food. Jalabert owns and runs his restaurant and the food was as you&#8217;d expect, sumptious!!! Lisa was very entertaining too!!! Had to get up really early on Mon am to catch the Eurostar back to UK, with just made croissants and pain au chocolat for our brekkies.

Situps good for posture, core stability and also for running form, while pressups are good for the musle, yes! I went running with the running club last night, was slower than last week but we did manage a few fast reps and up some hills too, reason why other people were not up for fast running was that they were racing over the weekend and were tired. Have been invited to the Weds sessions so may check them out in the future! The Weds sessions are longer, 8-10 miles and a continueous pace rather than the looping that happens on the Monday nights. Am very tempted, although will have to do more running and get even faster first! Something to aim for!!! Last week I did the VO2max test (as part of this running trial I am doing) and got a figure of 63.75. Bloody hard work. Went walking with Marion on Sunday, looking for a long route that&#8217;s exactly what we did. From here to beyond the Look Out in the woods, then back again, we did 25km (saying the distance in km is much better cos the figure is larger!) and Marion almost killed me when we worked this out! &#8220;Were you trying to kill me&#8221; she said,,, it&#8217;s excellent preparation for the GR20 I think!<br />\nEngland are through to the Rugby World Cup Final after narrowly beating France on Saturday.

I have great news: I have a girlfriend she&#8217;s called Marion (hi Marion mon amour!)  she&#8217;s funny sexy clever crazy intelligent excellent cook delightful taste in music always on the move doing something allthetime and she&#8217;s French&#8230;! We went to France on holiday stayed at her parent&#8217;s place and had an amazing time! Went to the beach almost every day she&#8217;s from the Med coast so the weather was absolutely mesmeric everyday blue sky sunshine and hot hot temps, met her Bro Aurele who&#8217;s currently on hols from his uni, met her parents, met Marion&#8217;s friends went to a wedding and buffet, a party in a huge mansion with family friends, fireworks on the beach, the Tall Ships Race (from the sea no less!!!) and feasted on amazing French cuisine, fresh fruit every day so got a bit of a paunch. Went running twice along a cycle path that runs for 40+km from her city, in the evenings around 8 when it was cool enough with shade and some wind. First day ran with Marion on in-line skates for 30 mins: 15 there and 15 back. The second time I went solo and slower and further, for 40 mins with music (Pheroahe Monche) on the mp3. Went to Castallet, drove up Mount Feron spectacular sunset views of Toulon. Many many fotographs to follow!!!</p>\n<p>After getting back from France finding England under ten thousand meters of water, finding that my bro spent 28 hours stranded by the water on the way from his home to London (he didn&#8217;t make it) in a pub,  after the shocks of the drug use in this year&#8217;s Tour de France (Vino used to be my hero, what a fucking idiot he is) I went to my auntie&#8217;s wedding in Norfolk. I&#8217;d agreed to take some fotographs at the wedding so was a bit strange not being able to get totally drunk straight off;) But there was plenty of free champagne floating around so we got there in the end! The event was relatively lo-key with all the family (ten thousand of us) and some of their friends. The location was great, in an old stately home that is currently being renovated into a hotel, after the dancing (my auntie K and her husband K met at dancing classes!) my cousins, uncle and I found that there was a tango evening on still (this being really late in the night) and my two cousins Roberta and Fiona were asked to join in. Neither had done any tango before but they were really good, especially Fi who&#8217;d done dance before. The next day was horrific, hungover and feeling dead i had to get out in the air kick a footie around for a while before getting in the car with my uncle Alastair for the longest drive in the world all the way back home, through vicous rain and eventually to sunshine.</p>\n<p>Running: Mon 16.07 30 mins *route unknown*. 2 times in France. Since being back in England: Tue 31.07 I did a hilly 27 minute run around the local streets of Sandhurst and Crowthorne. Wed 01.08 I did the Broadmoor and Devil&#8217;s highway route in 43 mins in hot hot 11am heat.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-07-06T11:44:59","id":1172,"title":"June to July","excerpt":"<p>Running: (a brief resume):: 30.May:ELT (extended Long Toll); 1st.June:??; 4.June:Â WW (Walter&#8217;s Wood); 6th.June:River; 8.June:PO(Post Office &#8211; new route); 11.June:Stables; 13.June:River (36mins); 15 June:WW;Â Short Stables; 20.June: Extended River; 25th.June:Stables; 27.June:WW; 2nd.July:ELT (38 mins); 4.July:River (35 mins).

He usually runs here on a Sunday (either with SJ or <a href=\"http://www.bracknell-forest-runners.org.uk/index.php\">Bracknell Forest Runners</a>) and I joined him for 7 miles of single track. I will never know the route but I did occasionally recognise places that I have been through before. Got back after about 50 mins, where BFR were warming up for their run (they meet at 10, SJ at 9am). After driving home and getting showered I turned on the TV coverage of the London Marathon to see Zhou win the women&#8217;s race, and a little later Lel win the men&#8217;s race. It&#8217;s still going on, the fun runners (haha!) are still struggling through the record heat (max of ~25C) as I write this. Will find out tomorrow how well Paul and Liz from work did. 7 miles of off-road singletrack running in ~50 mins.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-04-20T18:41:32","id":1157,"title":"Longer Maple","excerpt":"<p>Running : &#8220;Mapledurham&#8221; is a new route that Mike and I ran this lunchtime for the first time.

Today I tried something different. I purposely tried to run slowly, taking it easy, if I had to ask myself &#8220;am i going too quickly?&#8221; then I was indeed and I slowed down a bit. What is the purpose of this you may ask. I have been reading &#8220;The Competetive Runner&#8217;s Handbook&#8221; by B. Glover and S-L. F. Glover and even though I admit at this stage I am far from the fastest runner in the town it does have excellent advice to all runners, including me. I&#8217;ve read a few chapters so far and I get the message that if you mix your training up, thus keeping it interesting, then your running benefits, as do your race times. It also recommends more days per week, and an increased per-week mileage. So this is what I will be doing. From 3 times a week to 4, then see how I feel before increasing further. Obviously now that I have done an &#8220;easy&#8221; run I will have to do a &#8220;hard&#8221; run. Whoa hahahaha!

Reading went 3-0 down inside 7 minutes. They could have wilted and got beaten by a much larger score but no, they stuck in and got reorganised and set about slowly beginning the massive task of trying to score at least three goals. They almost did it, thanks to their perseverence and ManU&#8217;s lack of concentration, losing 3-2. The atmosphere at the Majeski was tremendous and it was an excellent game, very exciting, but it was a shame that Reading were asleep for the first 7 minutes. ManU now go through to the quarter-finals and face M&#8217;bro away on the 10th of March.</p>\n"},{"date":"2007-02-21T13:25:37","id":1139,"title":"Running","excerpt":"<p>Today &#8211; ~5 miles in ~45 mins (reverse long-toll, got very lost but made out of woods alive; next time I take a map;)).

We RULE!!!</p>\n<p>Yesterday I went to London to see &#8220;The History Boys&#8221; at the Wyndham Theatre (near China Town). It was the best play I have seen this year, it was so funny, clever, unpredictable, exciting! I chose to sit in the cheepo seats, soo high up at the very back of the theatre that got initial vertico cos the stage soo far down. The play, written by Alan Bennett, was about a group of 8 superbright 18yr-old boys preparing to take the Oxbridge entrance exam (after completing their a-levels, potential oxbridge students (up until the 1970s) went back to school for a term to prepare to try to get into <span >Oxbridge</span>) and the play dealt with this, the possible homosexuality of their teachers and &#8220;the boys&#8221;, with clever interaction between the cast ensamble. The head teacher was more of a business man, concerned with buzzwords, management, he didn&#8217;t give a fuck about the actual learning, just the results and the figures. There was a battle between the new teaching methodology (employed by the new &#8220;Oxbridge Graduate&#8221; teacher) and the old (as taught by their ancient General Studies teacher). Plus there was a not-so-bright kid, who wrote everything down, for contrast.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news.php?id=news/2007/feb07/feb10news\">Disco to drop Ivan and Co at end of 2007</a></p>\n"},{"date":"2007-02-11T08:00:30","id":1135,"title":"me widgets ain&#8217;t grooving to the Flux","excerpt":"<p>Here is a quote: The stupid neither forgive nor forget; the naive forgive and forget; the wise forgive but do not forget. &#8211; Thomas Szasz What is up?

Really excellent film. Dench and Blanchett deliver mesmerising acting masterclasses and its an intriguing story. Picked up a new pair of black converse boots and then hotfooted back home to catch the first rugger game. Sooo dull and boring that went to sleep and missed France annihilate Italy 39-3. But I did see England return to their World Cup winning form with a resurgant Jonny Wilkinson scorring 27 perfect points, Jason Robinson scorring a try and Scotland being destroyed 42-20.

The Gunners beat us 2-1. Saturday we went to The Avery to watch Liverpool beat Chelsea 2-0, then to the cinema and watch <em>Rocky Balboa</em> which we thought was bloody entertaining but (surprise surprise) a <strong>little far fetched</strong>.</p>\n<p>The rest of the week.
